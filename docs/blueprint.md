## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#D4AF37) for a sophisticated and professional look.
- Background color: Dark gray (#1E1E1E) to provide contrast and modern feel. Use light desaturation for this color
- Accent color: Lighter gold (#FFD700), analogous to the primary gold but brighter, for CTAs and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, neutral look; suitable for headlines or body text
- Use clear and professional icons from 'shadcn/ui' with gold accents.
- Split screen design for login page with hero image and glass-morphism effect.
- Subtle animations and transitions for a smooth user experience. Avoid animations more expressive than 'fade' or 'slide'.
